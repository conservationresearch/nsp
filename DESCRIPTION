Description: "This package performs a cost-benefit analysis of potential conservation projects.
	The benefits in this package are measured as Green Status metrics and scores while
	the costs are the finincial costs of the projects and their potential for funding. The analysis requires 
	an input csv file containing expert elicited P5, P50, and P95 quantiles of the Green Score metrics and the project 
	costs for each potential project (See example dataset to see exact formatting). A Metalog distribution is then produced from 
	these input quantiles and using a Monte Carlo simulation, values are selected from this distribution to be used in the analysis. 
	Analysis options are provided to allow users and organizations to best incoporate their values when quantifying benefit. 
	into how they prioritize projects."
