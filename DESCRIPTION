Description: "This package performs a cost-benefit analysis of potential conservation projects to identify the 
	projects. The benefits in this package are Green Score metrics produced throuhg expert elicitation while
	the costs are the finincial costs of the projects and their potential for funding. The analysis requires 
	an input csv file containing the P5, P50, and P95 quantiles of the Green Score metrics and the project 
	costs for each potential project. Metalog distribution functions use these input quantiles to generate 
	values used in the analysis. Analysis options are provided to allow users to best incoporate their values
	into how they prioritize projects."
